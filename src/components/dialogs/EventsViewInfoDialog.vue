               There are some significant differences to how this view works compared to the 'Bus Events View'

            The Events view shows events that have been read from nodes, captured from the CAN Bus, or entered manually

            <div class="text_body1">

          <div class="text_body1">
            The list is likely to be very large, as some nodes have large numbers of default events

          <div class="text_body1">
            So it's recommended to use the search option to filter the list, and using group names for events
