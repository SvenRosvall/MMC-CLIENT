            The Bus Events view is intended to show the event activity on the CAN Bus from the start of the application
          </div>
          <div class="text_body1 text-weight-bold">
               There are some significant differences to how this view works compared to the 'Events View'

              But these default events will appear in this view once they've been sent

          <div class="text_body1">
              This view takes account of the source node, so if the same event has been sent by two different nodes,
               there will be two entries for that event
          </div>
          <div class="text_body1">
               This is intended to make it easy to see which nodes are sending which events

        <q-card class="q-pa-sm">
          <div class="text_body1">
              In this view, the 'send ON/OFF' feature will use the Source Node Number of the row selected, thus replicating the event from that specific node

        <q-card class="q-pa-sm">
          <div class="text_body1">
            The ON/OFF status for each event will be the most recent instance of that event, captured from the CAN Bus, from that particular sending node

        <q-card class="q-pa-sm">
          <div class="text_body1">
              The Bus Events view will be empty at startup, and can also be cleared, to only show events from that point onwards

        <q-card class="q-pa-sm">
          <div class="text_body1">
            The SEARCH option will filter on all of the text columns (such as Name & Group), and is not case sensitive, e.g. will find both 'switch' and 'Switch'
          </div>
          <div class="text_body1">
            It also matches partial text, so searching for 'switch' will find both 'switch-01' and 'switch-02'
